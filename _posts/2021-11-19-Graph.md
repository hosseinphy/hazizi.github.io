excerpt: Build a social graph of social connections of the population, and used that to determine influential people within the group.

## Summary
For this project, we will assemble the social graph of social connections from photo captions for parties in NYC, and determined most influential people, and the most tightly coupled pairs.

## Data format 
The photographs from the gathering and events can potentially represent the social connection of New York's social elite. The data is collected from annotated photo captions that imply the connections between individuals appered in those photographs. 

## Data Gathering 
Crawl the HTML files to extract $\sim$ 96000 captions from more than 1100 photo pages. Pyhton Requests and BeautifulSoup are used to download and process the HTML.

## Parsing captions
The preprocessing step includes pasring names from captions where the following steps were taken:
<ul>
  <li>Isolating list of names by eliminating narrative texts, sentences, and commonly repeated words/patterns, using nltk (part-of-speech tagging, Chunking/Chinking, Frequncy distribution) and regex</li>
  <li>Using some heuristic rule with regex to split captions, find and filter out the titles (Mayor, president, etc.), and parse couples name</li>  
</ul>

## Assemble the graph
As discussed before, this problem can be resembled by a graph that represents social relations between people where a pair of people appear in a photo together corresponds to a link.  An obvious mathematical analoge for this systems is an undirected [weighted graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29#Weighted_graph). To construct such graph we used [`networkx`](https://networkx.github.io/) library.

## Identify social relations
Using the social graph, we can make guesses at the most popular socialites or influentional people, and the most tightly coupled pairs.
The most popular individuals are those with highest numebr of connections (i.e. nodes with biggest degree). Another approch employed to determine popularity is  
[PageRank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank), which is used for web ranking. The most tightly coupled pairs (best friends) that tend to coappear with each other are graph edges with highest weight. The figure below shows the subgraph of the social graph "G" for top 50 most popular people. 
can be found by cointing the number of connection 

```python
from pyvis.network import Network

SG = nx.subgraph(G, top_nodes)
net = Network(notebook=True, height='1000px', width='1000px')
net.from_nx(SG)
net.show('SG.html')
```
