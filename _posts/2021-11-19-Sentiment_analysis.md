excerpt: Extract the sentiment form text data.
---

In this project, our objective is to extract sentiment form more than 250000 Yelp review data. We build and train a model that can predict rating of reviews based on the text of reviews. Another approch is to look at the polarity of words. We deployed a naive Bayes model to claculate the polarity of words.
