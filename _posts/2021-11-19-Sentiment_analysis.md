Unstructured data makes up the vast majority of data.  This is a basic intro to handling unstructured data.  Our objective is to be able to extract the sentiment (positive or negative) from review text.  We will do this from Yelp review data.

The first three questions task you to build models, of increasing complexity, to predict the rating of a review from its text.  These models will be assessed based on the root mean squared error of the number of stars predicted.  There is a reference solution (which should not be too hard to beat) that defines the score of 1.

The final question asks only for the result of a calculation, and your results will be compared directly to those of a reference solution.
