Stack Overflow is a collaboratively edited question-and-answer site originally focused on programming topics. Because of the variety of features tracked, including a variety of feedback metrics, it allows for some open-ended analysis of user behavior on the site.

Stack Exchange (the parent organization) provides an anonymized data dump, and we'll use Spark to perform data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning on this data set. As a side note, there's also an online data explorer which allows you to query the data interactively.
