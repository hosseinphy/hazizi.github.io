# Simulation of heat & mass transfer in particulate fuel combustion systems (forest fire model)
#### Research Associate McGill Sep 2017 - January 2018

<p style="font-size:15px">
  In this project we created simulation of heat-mass transfer process to assist in design new porous materials, with potential use in energy-efficient products.
  The results of this specific system also can be applied to combustion flames in a suspension of metal particles and more general case of interface propagation in heterogeneous excitable media which has a vast range of applications from biology to  for example in biology, the dynamics of calcium waves released from spatially random distributed sources.
