### Achievements   
<ul>
<li>Designed & implemented a high-performance computing algorithm for large-scale simulations of a solidification during 3D Metal Printing process of mechanical parts, resulting in 35x speedup across 1024 cores by incorporating MPI-AMR techniques. </li> 
<li> Supervised and trained a team to apply simulation to improve decision making process and partsâ€™ quality. </li>   
<li> Analyzed and interpreted research data, wrote and reviewed reserch results for publications.     
<li>Initiated process automation that required to collect, interpret, and visualize more than 10TB of data during 3D printing simulation. Accelerated processing time 7-fold (from 14 to 2 days).</li> 
</ul>
